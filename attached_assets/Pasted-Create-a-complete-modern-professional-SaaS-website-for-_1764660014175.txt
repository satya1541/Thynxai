Create a complete, modern, professional SaaS website for **ThynxAI**, designed in the same style as the Effica site (effica.framer.ai).

Match Effica’s:
• clean, minimal, premium light-mode aesthetic  
• large whitespace  
• soft grey/white UI  
• refined typography  
• simple icons  
• section spacing  
• overall layout structure  
• conversion-focused UX  
• small, smooth animations  
• honest business tone  
• clear service messaging  

Do NOT copy Effica’s content or branding.  
Use the Effica “style” only — structure, simplicity, professionalism, clarity.

The website is for **ThynxAI – The Operating System of Technology**, offering 4 core services:

1. **Idea Lab — Your Personal AI Consultant**  
   For users with innovative ideas.  
   AI guides them through feasibility, requirements, limitations, advantages, estimated cost, recommended team structure, and generates a full “Idea Lab Report.”

2. **Thynx Studio — Your Personal Technology Officer**  
   Helps users hire the right people for their project.  
   AI integrates with LinkedIn/Fiverr/Indeed/Naukri to find matching talent.  
   Estimates employee cost, project timelines, builds Agile task boards like Jira, issue tracking, bug workflows, and manages transparent payments.

3. **Thynx Repo — Your Personal AI Repository**  
   A GitHub/GitLab-style in-house repository for hosting code, version control, branches, commits, collaborative development, and secure team access.

4. **Thynx Free Market — Zero Commission Marketplace**  
   A marketplace where people can list software, apps, websites, or source code.  
   Creators keep 100% of earnings.  
   Product previews, transparent delivery, and direct payments.
